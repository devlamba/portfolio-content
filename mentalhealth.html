    <h1>LGBTQIA+ Mental Health</h1>

      <p>LGBTQ people are at higher risk of anxiety and depression. Gay men are more likely to experience body image issues and eating disorders than are their straight counterparts. While domestic violence can affect anyone in an intimate relationship, gay men and lesbian women might be more likely to stay quiet about this kind of violence due to fear of discrimination. Although being LGBTQ+ is absolutely not a mental illness, many LGBTQ+ people experience mental health struggles. The bisexual and transgender communities have the highest rates of mental health concerns within the LGBTQ+ population.</p>
      <p>Younger members of the LGBTQ+ community struggle the most with mental health concerns of all the age groups.

        Most LGBTQ+ individuals are incredibly resilient and will thrive in the face of adversity, with the help of supportive families, communities, and peers. One study even found that LGBTQ+ people used mental health services at 2.5 times higher rates than their heterosexual counterparts. However, they are also at particular risk for experiencing shame, fear, discrimination, and adverse and traumatic events. Also, many people who identify as LGBTQ+ are part of second (and sometimes third or more) community that is marginalized. Examples of these groups are BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, or People of Color), people with a physical disability, people practicing a religion different than their neighbors, and people with low socioeconomic status. These people have complex experiences that cannot be easily addressed in one area of their life.</p>
